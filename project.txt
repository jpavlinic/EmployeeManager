üõ†Ô∏è Project 1: Employee Management System (Monolithic Architecture)
Concepts Covered:
Spring Core: Dependency Injection, IoC
Spring Boot: Application setup, configuration, and auto-configuration
Spring MVC: RESTful APIs and request handling
Spring Data JPA (Hibernate): ORM, entity relationships
Spring Security: User authentication & authorization with JWT
Spring AOP: Logging user activities and method execution
Project Description:
Develop a backend system to manage employee records. It will support basic CRUD operations for employees, along with user authentication and logging for important actions.

Features:
User Registration & Login: Authenticate users with JWT tokens.
Role-Based Access Control: Admins can manage all employees; regular users can view their own records.
Employee Management: Add, update, delete, and view employee details.
Activity Logging: Use Spring AOP to log operations like employee additions, deletions, and updates.
Project Structure:
Authentication Module

User registration and login endpoints.
Secure APIs with Spring Security (JWT).
Employee Management Module

CRUD operations for employees.
Uses Spring Data JPA with MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Logging Module (AOP)

Logs method calls and user actions (e.g., "Employee X updated by User Y").
Key Learning Points:
Spring Core: Understand how beans are managed and injected.
Spring Boot: Learn how Spring Boot auto-configures and simplifies application development.
Spring MVC: Implement REST APIs for employee management.
Spring Data JPA: Manage relational data using Hibernate and JPA repositories.
Spring Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and JWT-based protection.
Spring AOP: Use aspects to log application activity without cluttering business logic.
Suggested Endpoints:
Auth:

POST /auth/register ‚Äì Register a new user
POST /auth/login ‚Äì Login and receive JWT
Employee:

GET /employees ‚Äì Get all employees (Admin only)
GET /employees/{id} ‚Äì Get employee by ID
POST /employees ‚Äì Add a new employee (Admin only)
PUT /employees/{id} ‚Äì Update employee details
DELETE /employees/{id} ‚Äì Delete employee (Admin only)
Logging:

Log whenever an employee is created, updated, or deleted.
Tools/Technologies:
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Security: Spring Security with JWT
Logging: Spring AOP + SLF4J/Logback
Build Tool: Maven
